Education is the foundation of personal and societal development, shaping the 
trajectory of individuals’ lives and contributing to the advancement of 
communities. Our OpenGL project, " The Epilogue of Education " is a visual 
and interactive representation of the educational journey, starting from 
kindergarten to university graduation. This project encapsulates various elements 
of a student’s life through dynamic and visually appealing OpenGL features, 
providing an immersive experience for users to reflect on the significance of 
education.
